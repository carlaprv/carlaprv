I'm a Software Engineer who is passionate about making open-source, creating technology to elevate people and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Python and Tensorflow! 

Current, I'm a MSc student in Artificial Intelligence and my research is about the unconscious bias in Artificial Intelligence and Explainable Artificial Intelligence. 

I recently was selected to be an and Google Developer Expert for Machine Learning 🌟 based on my involvement in the tech community and artificial intelligence. 

My interest in building community led me to participate as co-organizer at [perifaCode](https://perifacode.com/), a community for minorities groups in technology.
