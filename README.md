### Hi there! I'm Carla

I am a Software Engineer, speaker, master student in Artificial Intelligence and coordinator at [perifaCode](https://perifacode.com/). I believe technology is steadily changing the social good landscape and I've been researching about the unconscious bias in Artificial Intelligence and its impacts on our society.
